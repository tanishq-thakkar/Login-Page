1. Install Spring Boot: There is a possibility of incompatibility with current project dependencies. Mitigation Strategy: Review and ensure 
compatibility of the Spring Boot version with existing dependencies, updating them as needed.

2. Hibernate JPA: Errors in configuration may disrupt database connections. Mitigation Strategy: Perform detailed testing with sample datasets and 
correctly configure Hibernate settings.

3. Create Database: Potential data loss or corruption during the setup process. Mitigation Strategy: Use robust backup systems and establish 
database in a controlled setup to prevent data issues.

4. Create Project Controller: Inaccurate request mappings could cause issues with API endpoints. Mitigation Strategy: Ensure accurate mapping of 
requests and conduct extensive tests with varied request types.

5. Tomcat Testing: Problems may arise from improper Tomcat server configurations during deployment. Mitigation Strategy: Execute comprehensive tests 
in a staging environment prior to live deployment.

6. Routing: Incorrect routing setups might lead to navigation errors such as page not found. Mitigation Strategy: Carefully check routing setups and 
test extensively using various URLs.

7. Home Page: Risks include UI/UX inconsistencies and navigational complications. Mitigation Strategy: Run user acceptance tests and continuously 
incorporate feedback from stakeholders for improvements.

8. NAVbar: Issues may occur across different browsers or screen sizes. Mitigation Strategy: Adhere to responsive design principles and conduct tests 
across multiple browsers.

9. Edit, Add, Users: There's a risk of security breaches and data validation issues. Mitigation Strategy: Enforce stringent data validation and 
security protocols including input sanitization and robust authentication systems.

10. Unit Testing: Limited test coverage could miss bugs. Mitigation Strategy: Develop an extensive unit testing framework that addresses all 
critical paths and potential edge cases.
